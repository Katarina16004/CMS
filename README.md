# ðŸ“š Content Management System (CMS) â€“ WPF Project

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
It provides a local solution for managing digital content on a chosen theme. The system supports two user roles:
- **Admin** â€“ can add, edit, and delete content.
- **Visitor** â€“ can only browse and view content.

All content is stored locally using **XML** for data persistence and **RTF** files for text documents. The application ensures a clear separation of roles, user-friendly interaction, and a visually consistent UI.
